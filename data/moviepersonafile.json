Indy gives the whip a short pull and Barranca's arm in jerked down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the dirt.  Barranca is amazed, but feels some slack in the whip and immediately raises the gun toward Indy again, cocking it with his free hand. Indy's face goes hard.  And sad. Indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc.  Barranca spins around, enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against his body.  Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle and Barranca's gun fires.  Barranca falls dead. Indy looks quickly at Satipo, who is shocked and fright- ened.
